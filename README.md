# ME405-Winter25-Term-Project
This repository encompasses the mecha25 team 's final report for the Winter 2025 term project for **Sam Sakaguchi** and **Timothy Chu**. This project documents everything about our Romi including what makes it unique, the desgin, pin cofiguration and coding process that made Romi drive autonomously on the course.

# The Course

Below is the image of the course. The starting position and the ending position are the exact same for the course. 
Requirements for this course include the following:
* Hitting all 6 checkpoints labeled (CP#) in order
* Hitting the wall at some point on the course
* Attempting to get the fastest time as possible
* Cups will be put over the 5s deduction spaces and must be pushed out of the circle for those to count.

The tricky part about this course was the line sensing portion. With multiple different scenarios, including the diamond before CP#1, the dashed lines and the perpendicular lines, Romi would go off course from even a little bit of misalignment, making it's behavior sparatic. This line following was then followed by a grid in which Romi would have to carefully navigate through the beams, turn 90 degrees and maneuver in between two beams to regain the line following. This then is followed by the wall in which Romi would have to navigate around as well in order to return to it's starting point of the last checkpoint.

# Romi Assembly

The Romi Robot integrates mutliple systems, including the following

* **Motor Drivers** are used to allow Romi to steer and allow wheel control with the **Encoders**
* **Encoders**, attached to the Motors allow us to monitor the position and velocity
* **IR Sensor Array** is used for following the line, calibrating the data and putting it into a closed loop controller to read the error and change the PWM of the motors accordingly
* **Bump Sensors** were used for multiple instances for our case. Initially, it was used to stop our Romi when triggered for ease of use, but currently, it was used to trigger a state within our main task to return to the starting position after hitting the wall.
* **Voltage Divider** (image shown below) was used to help with the motor compensation and monitor the amount of volts Romi was running each trial. With a full set of NiMH AA batteries, the total maximum voltage output would be 6 x 1.4V = 8.4V. R1 was set to 10K ohms and R2 was set to 4.7K ohms  to get a similar Vout that would convert the 8.4V to 3.3V for the ADC.

# What makes our Romi Unique
Our Romi is unique for a couple of reasons. On the hardware side, it is very similar to everyone else's robot, as it has the typical motor and encoders, the IR Sensor and the bump sensor as well. What makes our Romi unique is on the coding side. This code was inevitiably our problem as we decided to a voltage divider and had multiple parameters with arbitrary numbers to maintain the consistency of Romi depending on the battery charge of Romi.
